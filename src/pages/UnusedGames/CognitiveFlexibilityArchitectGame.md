# Cognitive Flexibility Architect Game

## Overview
The **Cognitive Flexibility Architect** is an advanced mental agility game that tests cognitive flexibility, set-shifting abilities, and adaptive reasoning through dynamic rule-switching categorization tasks.

## Game Features

### üß† **Core Concept**
- **Cognitive Flexibility**: The ONLY game in your collection testing mental set-shifting abilities
- **Adaptive Reasoning**: Rapidly adjusting strategies based on changing rules
- **Set-Shifting**: Switching between different cognitive frameworks
- **Rule Learning**: Discovering and applying new categorization rules

### üéØ **What is Cognitive Flexibility Architect?**
Cognitive Flexibility Architect is an advanced mental agility game that tests your ability to rapidly switch between different cognitive frameworks and adapt to changing rules. You'll categorize stimuli according to different sorting rules that change throughout the game, challenging your mental set-shifting abilities and adaptive reasoning skills.

### üéÆ **How to Play**

#### **üìã Step-by-Step Instructions:**

##### **1. Learn the Rule üìö**
- Each round starts with a sorting rule (color, shape, size, number, or pattern)
- Pay attention to the current rule displayed at the top of the screen
- The rule determines how you should categorize each stimulus

##### **2. Categorize Stimuli üéØ**
- Look at each stimulus (colored shape with various properties)
- Categorize it according to the current rule
- Click the appropriate category button from the available options

##### **3. Adapt Quickly ‚ö°**
- Rules change frequently without warning!
- When you notice the rule has changed, quickly adapt your strategy
- Use feedback to understand when rule changes occur

##### **4. Build Flexibility üß†**
- The faster you adapt to new rules, the higher your cognitive flexibility score
- Maintain mental agility and avoid getting stuck on old rules
- Quick adaptation leads to higher scores and longer streaks

### üîÑ **Five Sorting Rules**

#### **üé® Color Sorting**
- **Categories**: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow

- **Strategy**: Look only at the base color of the stimulus

#### **üî∑ Shape Sorting**
- **Categories**: Circle, Square, Triangle, Star
- **Focus**: Ignore color, size, number, and pattern
- **Strategy**: Identify the geometric shape regardless of other properties

#### **üìè Size Sorting**
- **Categories**: Small, Medium, Large
- **Focus**: Ignore color, shape, number, and pattern
- **Strategy**: Compare relative sizes of the stimuli

#### **üî¢ Number Sorting**
- **Categories**: 1, 2, 3, 4
- **Focus**: Count the white dots inside each shape
- **Strategy**: Focus on quantity regardless of other properties

#### **üîÑ Pattern Sorting**
- **Categories**: Solid, Striped, Dotted, Gradient
