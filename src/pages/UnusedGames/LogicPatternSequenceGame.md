## Pattern Types Explained

### Arithmetic Sequences
Numbers increase or decrease by a constant difference.
Example: 3, 7, 11, 15, ? (difference of +4, answer: 19)

### Geometric Sequences
Numbers are multiplied by a constant ratio.
Example: 2, 6, 18, 54, ? (ratio of ×3, answer: 162)

### Fibonacci-like Sequences
Each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.
Example: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ? (1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8)

### Square Numbers
Numbers that are perfect squares (n²).
Example: 1, 4, 9, 16, ? (1², 2², 3², 4², answer: 25 = 5²)

### Prime Numbers
Numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves.
Example: 2, 3, 5, 7, ? (answer: 11)

### Power Sequences
Numbers that follow exponential patterns.
Example: 2, 4, 8, 16, ? (2¹, 2², 2³, 2⁴, answer: 32 = 2⁵)

## Tips for Success

1. **Look for Common Patterns First**: Start with simple arithmetic or geometric progressions
2. **Check Differences**: Calculate the differences between consecutive numbers
3. **Look for Ratios**: Check if numbers are related by multiplication or division
4. **Consider Special Sequences**: Think about squares, cubes, primes, or Fibonacci
5. **Time Management**: Don't spend too long on one pattern; move on if stuck
6. **Practice**: The more patterns you see, the faster you'll recognize them
