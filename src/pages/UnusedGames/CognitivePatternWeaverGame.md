## Game Features

### 🧠 **Core Concept**
- **Spatial Memory**: Test your ability to encode, store, and recall spatial information
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and memorize complex visual patterns
- **Sequential Memory**: Remember the exact order of pattern elements
- **Visual-Spatial Intelligence**: Challenge your spatial reasoning abilities

### 🎯 **What is Cognitive Pattern Weaver?**
Cognitive Pattern Weaver is an advanced spatial memory and pattern recognition game that challenges your visual-spatial intelligence. You'll study complex patterns of colored shapes arranged on a grid, then recreate them from memory in the exact same sequence. This game tests your ability to encode, store, and recall spatial information while maintaining attention to detail.

### 🎮 **How to Play**

#### **📋 Step-by-Step Instructions:**

##### **1. Study Phase (📚)**
- A pattern of colored shapes appears on the grid with sequence numbers
- Memorize the positions, colors, shapes, and the order they should be clicked
- Pay attention to each element's position, color, shape, and sequence number
- You have 2.5-4 seconds depending on difficulty level

##### **2. Memorize Phase**
- Focus on creating mental associations between shapes, colors, and positions
- Use spatial chunking to group related elements
- Practice visual rehearsal of the sequence
- Note the sequence numbers for correct order

##### **3. Recreate Phase (🎯)**
- The pattern disappears completely
- Click the grid cells in the exact same order as shown in the original pattern
- Progress indicator shows how many elements you've selected
- Only correct positions can be clicked (prevents random guessing)

##### **4. Feedback Phase (✨)**
- See if you got it right with detailed visual feedback
- Correct patterns earn points and build your streak
- Review the correct pattern if you made mistakes
- Learn from errors to improve future performance
